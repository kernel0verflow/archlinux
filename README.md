# Setup of my archlinux installation 2022

## Introduction
I've decided to create a Github Repo to save all of my archlinux configuration files. Not everything is in this repository yet. There are many different repositorys for the tools like (dwm, st, dmenu. etc.)
I'm thinking about merging all the dependencies and application into one Repository for ease of use.

__Warning__: I'am not responsible for breaking your system. I only tried this on my own Hardware, which is listet on my Github Profile Page. If you are interested in more information about me, my skill or my hardware in general, I recommend visiting my homepage (which ist currently WIP).

## Dependencies
Install the following packages via pacman.
